== 1.0

This is the first stable release of LMS Connector. It introduces a lot
of changes since the latest pre-release.

=== New Features and Improvements
* Java 11 is supported.
* Start and end dates of courses are retrieved from the LMS's and have
  been added to the API.
* The configuration file uses YAML format. Its location is set as a
  Java system property.
* Optimized SQL queries for performance.
* The mapping of Moodle user role IDs can be changed in configuration.
* The client library uses annotations to support caching of course and
  membership data.
* Frameworks and libraries have been updated.

=== Bug Fixes
* A NullPointerException, which was caused by the SQL query for Moodle
  course memberships in some cases, has been fixed.
* A compatibility issue with the PostgreSQL JDBC driver has been fixed.

=== Removed Features
* The deprecated Stud.IP REST API plugin is no longer supported.
* Ilias integration was removed because its feature set was not
  consistent with integrations for other LMS's. It might resurface in a
  future release.
* Token authentication is no longer supported.
* LDAP is no longer supported.
* CORS HTTP headers are no longer set.
